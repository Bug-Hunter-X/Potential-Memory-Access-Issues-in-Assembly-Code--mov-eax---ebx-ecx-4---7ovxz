This repository demonstrates a potential memory access bug in a short assembly code snippet. The bug arises from the use of `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]`, which can lead to segmentation faults, alignment issues, integer overflows, and use-after-free errors if the values of `ebx` and `ecx` are not carefully managed. The `bug.asm` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a possible solution using appropriate error handling (if possible in the specific context) and defensive programming techniques.
