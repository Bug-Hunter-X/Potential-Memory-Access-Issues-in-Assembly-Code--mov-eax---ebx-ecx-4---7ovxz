To mitigate these risks:

1. **Bounds checking:** Before the instruction, add checks to verify that `ebx` and `ecx` are within valid ranges.  You'll need to know the size of the allocated memory block and ensure the calculated address is within its boundaries.  This may involve additional comparisons and conditional jumps.
2. **Alignment checks:** Ensure that the calculated address is properly aligned if required by the architecture and the data type being accessed.  You might need to adjust the address or use different instructions to handle unaligned access (if supported by your architecture).  Failure to align could lead to unpredictable behaviour on some architectures.
3. **Integer overflow prevention:** For 32-bit systems, use 64-bit arithmetic if large values of `ebx` and `ecx` are possible. This prevents overflow, but it has a performance overhead. 
4. **Memory management:** Use appropriate memory allocation and deallocation mechanisms to avoid use-after-free errors.  Implement robust error handling.   In more modern contexts, using higher level languages would help with memory management greatly.
5. **Robust error handling:** Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions or signals resulting from memory access violations. 

Example (Illustrative - Implementation depends heavily on the specific assembly language and target architecture):

;Assume ebx points to the start of a 100-element array and ecx contains the index

mov edx, ecx
mov eax, 100
cmp edx,eax;check if index is less than 100
jge error_handler ;handle error
mov eax, [ebx + ecx * 4] ; Access memory safely
jmp next_instruction
error_handler:
;Handle error appropriately
next_instruction:
